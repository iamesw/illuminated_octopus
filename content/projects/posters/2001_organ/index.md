			<p>Visual Design II. Summer of 2001, Auburn University. The assignment was design a public service announcement for any cause of our choosing. Growing up with a nurse as my mother, medical issues were always a consideration, and so organ donation made sense.</p>
            <p>During crit a classmate was surprised, and having seen the poster said they had never considered being an organ donor before, but now they would likely check the box the next time they renewed their license.</P>
