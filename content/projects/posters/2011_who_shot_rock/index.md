			<p>The summer of 2011 saw the arrival of <em>Who Shot Rock & Roll</em> at the Birmingham Museum of Art. An exhibition featuring photos of pop culture icons, the focus was less on the performers and more on the photographers who took the iconic photos. As such the thrust of the marketing materials was framing each photograph through the perspective of the photographer. The aesthetic was built in support of "rock n roll" with distressed text and grimy texture.</p>
            <p>The poster campaign won local and regional Silver Addy Awards.</P>
