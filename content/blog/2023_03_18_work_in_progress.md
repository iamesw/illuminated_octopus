<p>I'm continuing to learn the ins and outs of 11ty and static sites. The process is helping me think through larger projects at work, particularly in developing new brand standards and thinking of ways to carry them across different platforms and media. </p>
<p>As much as I would like to spend a bunch of time tweaking and setting up the site, then releasing it in a perfect form, it looks like I'm going to be running an iterative design process in public so to speak. Nothing is going to be complete, there will likely be some placeholders in random places, and I'll just continue refining over time. Perhaps the best way to think of it is as a long-running web development / design experiment. It will never be finished, but will hopeful be refined to a really nice level of fit and finish at some point. </p>
<p>To that end, I'm trying to avoid painting myself into corners with taxonomy and structure and all those things. I have a sneaking suspicion I won't manage to do that entirely. Putting portfolio or projects into a blog structure doesn't seem quite right, but I'm hoping that at least using a consistent tag structure I can build out collections later. Time will tell, but if you're here reading this now, welcome to my trials and errors.</p>
