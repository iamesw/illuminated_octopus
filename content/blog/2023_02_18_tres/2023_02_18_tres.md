One of the paintings I mentioned in the "about" page. Inanimate object. In this case, a street sign, blown over in the wind. Photographed. Drawn. Glitched. Painted. Acrylic on wood. 

{% image "./end_one_way.jpg", "A painting of a street sign, laying on its side, image broken and fragemented like a digital glitch" %}

## What now?

I need to start sorting out CSS. And image galleries. And things like that. Fonts. I'd like some of those, custom of course, though the defaults here are all right.
