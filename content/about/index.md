      <p>Time and place are recurring themes in my personal practice. As a designer I am in service to the content of the project. Not by minimalism or strict Swiss style, but guided by a clean and unfussy approach.</p> 
      <p>Though my focus is producing books and catalogs for artists, galleries, and museums; I am experienced in branding and marketing design and offer a comprehensive set of design services.</p>
