# what is this?

Illuminated Octopus is the 11ty project of James Williams.

I design things, photograph things, occasionally print or paint things. The photographs, prints, and paintings are typically of inanimate objects or places. Rarely people, but more often of late a dog, cats, and chickens. But mostly things like parking structures, doors, manhole covers, and other things discovered walking old and new places. 

Things designed. Magazines, books, brochures, logos, and other assorted things "graphic design."

I am currently the Director of Design at the Birmingham Museum of Art.
